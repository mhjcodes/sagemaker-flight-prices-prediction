# End-to-End Machine Learning using AWS SageMaker

## Overview

- **Step 1: Introduction to AWS SageMaker**
  - Overview of SageMaker, S3, EC2 & IAM features and capabilities
  - Setting up AWS environment and SageMaker instance

- **Step 2: GitHub Setup & Data Cleaning**
  - Setting up local & remote repository using GitHub
  - Data Cleaning using Numpy and Pandas best practices

- **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Understanding the workflow of systematically analyzing datasets
  - Understanding the various plots, statistical measures and hypothesis tests to analyze datasets
  - Exploring a custom EDA module for convenience and significantly reduce complexity of analyzing datasets
  - Performing in-depth analysis of various kinds of numeric, categorical and date-time variables
  - Leveraging statistical measures, hypothesis tests, and univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots

- **Step 4: Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing**
  - Understanding feature engineering teachniques for different types of variables
  - Creating scikit-learn compatible custom classes and functions
  - Using advanced scikit-learn features for feature engineering and data preprocessing such as:
     - Pipeline
     - Feature Union
     - Function Transformer
     - Column Transformer

- **Step 5: Model Training and Deployment**
  - Training and Tuning a machine learning model on SageMaker
  - Using S3 buckets for storage and EC2 for computing purposes
  - Creating a web application from scratch and deploying over cloud using Streamlit
